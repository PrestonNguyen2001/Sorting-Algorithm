# Sorting-Algorithm

## Introduction
This repository hosts a Python script for a Sorting Algorithm Visualizer built using Pygame. The visualizer allows users to observe and understand the sorting process of algorithms like Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort through interactive visualization.

## Functionality 
The Sorting Algorithm Visualizer offers the following features:

- Visualization of sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort.
- Real-time rendering of the sorting process, allowing users to observe each step.
- User controls to start and stop sorting, switch between ascending and descending order, and switch between sorting algorithms.

## How It Works
The visualizer operates as follows:

1. Initialization: The Pygame window is set up, and a random list of integers is generated.
2. Visualization Loop: The program enters a loop where it listens for user input and renders the sorting process.
3. Sorting Algorithms: Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort algorithms are implemented as generator functions, allowing step-by-step visualization of the sorting process.
4. User Interaction: Users can interact with the visualizer by starting and stopping sorting, changing the sorting order, and switching between sorting algorithms.

## Usage 
To run the Sorting Algorithm Visualizer:

1. Ensure you have Python and Pygame installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the main.py script using Python.
5. Use the keyboard controls displayed in the Pygame window to interact with the visualizer.
